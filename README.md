# AR Bubbles ðŸ§¼

> A prototype experiment to get more familiar with ARFoundation, using microphone input and some Shader Graph.

Blow into the mic, preferably from close by, to blow AR bubbles.

- Bubbles that are close enough to each other can merge into one
- Sometimes special bubbles are spawned
- A bubble colliding with a detected plane should pop, tapping it should make it pop too
- A real messy class that can generate a new icon every build, utilizing the `PreviewRenderUtility` class. Fun to try but in hindsight a _really bad_ idea
